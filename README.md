# MathQuillEditor

This is a holding place for experiments with adapting an entry palette to work with MathQuill 0.10.  
Uses a version of MathQuill with some tweaks.

###demo2.html
A test of using a span for substituteTextarea, with my keyboardPassthrough extension.  
or testing compatibility with different browsers and bluetooth keyboards.
  
Results so far: Seems to work on all desktop browsers, Android Chrome w/ Bluetooth, iOS Safari w/ Bluetooth (except for arrow keys)

###test.php
A pop-up equation editor for answer IMathAS questions.  Currently using keyboardPassthrough instead of direct entry.

###test2.php
Another pop-up editor, for general math writing purposes, with a lot more symbols.  Using direct entry.

Letter entry should be reformatted into querty layout

Definite integral doesn't display right on mobile.

###test3.php
Same as test2.php, but wiht span for ssubstituteTextarea and with keyboardPassthrough
